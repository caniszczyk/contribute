When adding a new project to the list, add an entry to the table under the CNCF Projects section. The table is sorted
by Maturity, than by project name. Use the below template to add project details in the corresponding location in the
doc itself.

If a project changes maturity level, update the location in the project table and relocate the project details to
the new location within the specific maturity level section.

NOTE: Frequently used links have been given their own markdown reference links. These cover things such as licenses and
CLAs used by the various projects. You will find a list below the project template available to use for your own
convenience.

CNCF Projects
=============

All projects of the Cloud Native Computing Foundation are classified with one of three stages of maturity:

-	[Graduated](https://github.com/cncf/toc/blob/master/process/graduation_criteria.adoc#graduation-stage)
-	[Incubated](https://github.com/cncf/toc/blob/master/process/graduation_criteria.adoc#incubating-stage)
-	[Sandboxed](https://github.com/cncf/toc/blob/master/process/graduation_criteria.adoc#sandbox-stage)

[CNCF Graduation Criteria](https://github.com/cncf/toc/blob/master/process/graduation_criteria.adoc) are documented in the CNCF TOC repo. The document describes the maturity stages of the projects.

### Virtual Kubelet

*"Virtual Kubelet is an open source Kubernetes kubelet implementation that masquerades as a kubelet for the purposes of connecting Kubernetes to other APIs. This allows the nodes to be backed by other services like ACI, AWS Fargate, Hyper.sh, IoT Edge etc. The primary scenario for VK is enabling the extension of the Kubernetes API into serverless container platforms like ACI, Fargate, and Hyper.sh, though we are open to others. However, it should be noted that VK is explicitly not intended to be an alternative to Kubernetes federation."* - [Virtual Kubelet Readme](https://github.com/virtual-kubelet/virtual-kubelet)

### OpenTelemetry

*"OpenTelemetry is made up of an integrated set of APIs and libraries as well as a collection mechanism via an agent and collector. These components are used to generate, collect, and describe telemetry about distributed systems. This data includes basic context propagation, distributed traces, metrics, and other signals in the future. OpenTelemetry is designed to make it easy to get critical telemetry data out of your services and into your backend(s) of choice. For each supported language it offers a single set of APIs, libraries, and data specifications, and developers can take advantage of whichever components they see fit.* - [What is OpenTelemetry? - opentelemetry.io](https://opentelemetry.io/)
