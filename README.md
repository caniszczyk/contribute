# CNCF Contributors Website

Welcome! Are you interested in contributing to one of CNCF hosted projects? This
repository contains information and guidelines about contributions to CNCF
projects.

We have recently transitioned from having people use the markdown files in this
repository directly to rendering them at the website above. See our
[Contributing Guide][contributing] for details on how to contribute to our
website.
