<!--

When adding a new project to the list, add an entry to the table under the CNCF Projects section. The table is sorted
by Maturity, than by project name. Use the below template to add project details in the corresponding location in the
doc itself.

If a project changes maturity level, update the location in the project table and relocate the project details to
the new location within the specific maturity level section.

NOTE: Frequently used links have been given their own markdown reference links. These cover things such as licenses and
CLAs used by the various projects. You will find a list below the project template available to use for your own
convenience.

All projects of the Cloud Native Computing Foundation are classified with one of three stages of maturity:

-	[Graduated](https://github.com/cncf/toc/blob/master/process/graduation_criteria.md#graduation-stage)
-	[Incubated](https://github.com/cncf/toc/blob/master/process/graduation_criteria.md#incubating-stage)
-	[Sandboxed](https://github.com/cncf/toc/blob/master/process/graduation_criteria.md#sandbox-stage)

[CNCF Graduation Criteria](https://github.com/cncf/toc/blob/master/process/graduation_criteria.md) are documented in the CNCF TOC repo. The document describes the maturity stages of the projects.
